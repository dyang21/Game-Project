# Lost In Space (Platformer) 
A  side-scrolling game with the time of completion as the scoring metric where the player-controlled character must jump and move between different types of suspended tiles to reach the end of the stages. 

Lost In Space is my first foray into game-making using Python; I had started this project in October 2019 to gain experience working on a large scale project on my own within a limited time frame. As of December 2019, this game is complete.

This project was developed independently utilizing Python3 and Pygame.
